# GW-Whisper

We introduce GW-Whisper, an innovative application of [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)’s [Whisper model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356), originally designed for speech recognition, to [gravitational wave (GW)](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/what-are-gw) data analysis. As the volume of data from advanced detectors like [LIGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO) and [Virgo](https://www.virgo-gw.eu/) grows, traditional methods face scalability challenges. GW-Whisper leverages Whisper’s pre-trained architecture to address critical tasks in GW astronomy, including signal detection and glitch classification, by fine-tuning the model using the parameter-efficient [DoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09353) method. This fine-tuning updates only 0.5% of the model’s parameters, significantly reducing computational costs.

## Getting Started

Each repository contains its own detailed documentation and setup instructions. This repo contains introductory information to the project and working with graviational wave data. We recommend starting with

1. [Our wiki page](https://github.com/vanderbilt-data-science/LIGO/wiki) for understanding our core architecture and methodology.
2. [Our exploratory notebooks](link-to-repo) to begin working with graviational wave data.
