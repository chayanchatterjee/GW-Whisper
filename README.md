## Getting Started

Each repository contains its own detailed documentation and setup instructions. This repo contains introductory information to the project and working with graviational wave data. We recommend starting with

1. [Our wiki page](https://github.com/vanderbilt-data-science/LIGO/wiki) for understanding our core architecture and methodology.
2. [Our exploratory notebooks](link-to-repo) to begin working with graviational wave data.
